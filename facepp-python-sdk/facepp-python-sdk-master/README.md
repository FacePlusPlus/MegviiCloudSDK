# FacePlusPlus Python SDK

This is the Face++ python SDK suite. Note that python2.7 is required.

## 1. cmdtool.py
This is an interactive command line tool which could be used to experiment
with Face++ APIs. It is recommended to have ipython installed so that you can
have tab-completion and some other nice features.

First please put your API key/secret in apikey.cfg. Then you can start the program
and you will drop into a python shell, where you can write something like:

    api.detect(image_file = File(r'<path to the image file>'))

Note that `api` here is a global variable.

## 2. call.py
This is a comprehensive demo for Face++ APIs. See the comments in the source
code for details.

## 3. facepp.py

This is the underlying API implementation.
